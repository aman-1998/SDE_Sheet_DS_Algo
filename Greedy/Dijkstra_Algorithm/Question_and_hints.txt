Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Statement: Given a directed graph. Find shortest distance from one source to
all other vertices.

Solution and Hint:-
--------------------
Source vertex is given.

1. Start from source vertex.
2. Relax all the outgoing edges from the source.
3. Then select the vertex with min distance from the source(so far which is not computed) and 
   mark it as computed and relax all the outgoing edges to the vertices which are not yet marked 
   computed.
