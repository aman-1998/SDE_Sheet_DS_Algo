Check if the given Linked List is Palindrome
----------------------------------------------
Problem Statement: Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.


Examples
Example 1:

Input Format:

LL: 1  2  3  2  1


Output: True

Explanation: A linked list with values "1 2 3 2 1" is a palindrome because its elements read the same 
from left to right and from right to left, making it symmetrical and mirroring itself.

Example 2:

Input Format:

LL: 1 2 3 3 2 1 


Output: True

Explanation: A linked list with values "1 2 3 3 2 1" is a palindrome because it reads the same 
forwards and backwards.

Example 3:

Input Format:

LL: 1 2 3 2 3


Output: False

Explanation: The linked list "1 2 3 2 3" is not a palindrome because it reads differently in 
reverse order, where "3 2 3 2 1" is not the same as the original sequence "1 2 3 2 3."
