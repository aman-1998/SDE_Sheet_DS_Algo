Starting point of loop in a Linked List
-----------------------------------------
Problem Statement: Given the head of a linked list that may contain a cycle, return the starting point 
of that cycle. If there is no cycle in the linked list return null.


Examples
Example 1:
Input: LL: 1  2  3  4  5 

Output: 3
Explanation: This linked list contains a loop of size 3 starting at node with value 3.
Example 2:
Input: LL: LL: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 9
                

Output: NULL
Explanation:  This linked list does not contain  a loop hence has no starting point.
