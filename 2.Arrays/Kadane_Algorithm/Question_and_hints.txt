Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array
------------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at 
least one number) which has the largest sum and returns its sum and prints the subarray.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] 

Output: 6 

Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. 

Examples 2: 

Input: arr = [1] 

Output: 1 

Explanation: Array has only one element and which is giving positive sum of 1.

We can slightly modify the above question by adding one more constraint.
Constraint: The length of sub-array shose sum is maximum should also be of maximum possible length.

Example 1:

Input: arr = {-3, -2, 4, -2, 3, 2, -1, 1};

Output: 4, -2, 3, 2, -1, 1

Explanation: Here two subarrays are possible {4, -2, 3, 2} and {4, -2, 3, 2, -1, 1} as both 
have sum 7 which is maximum. But since length of {4, -2, 3, 2, -1, 1} is greater than the length 
of {4, -2, 3, 2}. So, {4, -2, 3, 2, -1, 1} is the answer.
