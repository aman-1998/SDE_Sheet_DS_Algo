Shortest Subarray With Sum divisible by 7
------------------------------------------

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the length of shortest non-empty subarray that 
has a sum divisible by k.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4], k = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: [2, 2, 1, 2] and [1, 2, 4] are the two subarrays with sum divisible 7. 
		     So, shortest subarray whose sum is divisible by 7 is of size 3.
