Prim's Algorithm
-----------------------------
Problem Statement: Given a weighted graph. Find Minimal Spanning tree and it's cost.

Solution and Hint:-
--------------------
Starting vertex is given.

1. Start from given vertex.
2. Out of all the edges (from the vertices which are already visited) to the 
   vertices which are not yet visited, select the one with minimum cost.
3. Repeat 2nd step untill all the vertices are selected.
