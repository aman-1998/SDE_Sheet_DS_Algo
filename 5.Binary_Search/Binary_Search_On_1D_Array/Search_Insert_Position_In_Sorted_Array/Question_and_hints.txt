Search Insert Position In An Array
-----------------------------------
Problem statement: You are given a sorted array 'arr' of distinct values and a target value 'm'.


You need to search for the index of the target value in the array.


Note:
If the value is present in the array, return its index.
If the value is absent, determine the index where it would be inserted in the array while maintaining the sorted order. 


Example:
Input:  arr = [1, 2, 4, 7],  m = 6 

Output: 3

Explanation: If the given array 'arr' is: [1, 2, 4, 7] and m = 6. We insert m = 6 in the array and 
get 'arr' as: [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]. The position of 6 is 3 (according to 0-based indexing)


Note:
1) The given array has distinct integers.

2) The given array may be empty.
